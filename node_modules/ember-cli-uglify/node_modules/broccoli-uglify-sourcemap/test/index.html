  Open this in your browser to see how it interprets the given file's
  sourcemap. Edit the line below to switch among the test results and
  their expected vs actual versions.

  A good way to verify the sourcemaps is to try to call the defined
  functions from the console, most of which are written to throw
  exceptions that you can then debug.
